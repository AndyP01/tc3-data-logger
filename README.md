## Overview 
Demo of high speed logging to CSV.  "High speed" simply denotes that I have optimized this as far as possible using TwinCAT Realtime Monitor.  There will still be improvements to be made and I am happy to receive pull requests if you wish to contribute. 

This code uses the fluent interface design pattern.  For more information see https://www.plccoder.com/fluent-code/
